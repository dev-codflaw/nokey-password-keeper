# NoKey - A Stupid Password Keeper

NoKey - A Stupid Password Keeper is a Chrome/Edge extension to display records from a JSON file.

## Disclaimer

It is highly influenced by my personal usage, not ready for production. Please feel free to use it at your discretion.

## Installation

Instead of installing the extension from the Store, you'll install it locally, so that you can possibly modify it and quickly test the changes.

Installing locally is sometimes called sideloading an extension.
